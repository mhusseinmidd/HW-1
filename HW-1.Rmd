## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```







## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
