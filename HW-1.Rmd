## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Christian Lehner and Andrew Holtz
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 3.5 hrs
* What gave you the most trouble: Understanding what objects are legal for what functions/ commands
* Any comments you have:





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

The graph shows the most delays of >30 minutes or more in the period between April and early July, which corresponds to late spring and early summer. The least delays of > 30 minutes tend to occur between September and november. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
x<-strptime(flights$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

flights<-flights %>% 
  mutate(month=month(x))
flights_day <- flights %>% 
  count(month) %>% 
  rename(num_flights_day=n)
flights_day

delayed_flights <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay>30) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_flights_delayed = n)


delayed_flights<-delayed_flights %>% 
  mutate (Prop_flights_delayed = round(delayed_flights$num_flights_delayed/flights_day$num_flights_day,3))

delayed_flights

ggplot(data=delayed_flights, aes(x = month, y = Prop_flights_delayed)) + geom_line()

```





## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?


Such customers should favor DL, since about 20% of its fleet is composed of airplanes manufactured before 1980. 

Note that the analysis excludes units of observation for which no year of manifacturing could be founds. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#According to this fortune article (http://fortune.com/2015/09/12/airline-seats-shrink/): 
#"The average seat pitch, a rough measure of legroom, has dropped from 35 inches before 
#airline deregulation in the 1970s to about 31 inches today." Hence, define old planes <1980. 

#1. Merge the planes dataset to the flights dataset: 
flights_planes<-left_join(flights, planes, by="plane")

#2. Proportion of Old Planes per carrier: 
num_planes_per_carrier <- flights_planes %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_planes=n)
num_planes_per_carrier

num_old_planes_per_carrier<-flights_planes %>%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  tally(year<1980) %>% 
  rename(num_old_planes=n)
num_old_planes_per_carrier

Old_planes<-flights_planes %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  mutate (Old_planes = round(num_old_planes_per_carrier$num_old_planes/num_planes_per_carrier$num_planes, 3)*100)
Old_planes

Old_planes %>%  arrange(desc(Old_planes))

ggplot(Old_planes, aes(x=carrier, y=Old_planes)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

```







## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
It appears that the highest unique number of flights for WN is to Texas. Specifically, WN operates 770 annual unique flights to destinations in Texas, followed by 297 to Florida and 236 to Louisiana.  
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
Although the numbers are different, it appears that WN operated flights tend to fly to the same three destinations, with 17,230 flights to TX, followed by 3992 to FL and 3362 to LA.

q3b<-q3b+ geom_bar(stat="identity") + xlab("Destination State") +  ylab("Total NO. of UNIQUE Flights")
q3b

```




## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?


The three graphs show a modest upwards trend, suggestive of the fact that as the weather condition increases in severity, so does the duration of a flight delayed. That is, for flights that were delayed more than 30 minutes, higher temprature (humidity, or windspeed) is correlated with longer delays. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Dataframe with flights delayed more than 30 minutes: 
flights2<-flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay>30)

#Dataframe with weather patterns of interest: 
weather2<-weather %>% 
  select(date, hour, temp, humidity, wind_speed)

#Joining datasets: 
flights_weather<-left_join(flights2, weather2, by="date")

#Collapsing on flight: 
firsts<-flights_weather %>% 
  group_by(flight) %>% 
  summarise(temp_first=first(temp), 
            humidity_first=first(humidity), 
            wind_speed_first=first(wind_speed),
            delayed_first=first(dep_delay))

q4a<-ggplot(firsts, aes(x=temp_first, y=delayed_first)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
q4a<-q4a+ xlab("Temprature at supposed departure time (F)") +  ylab("Delayed Time")
q4a

q4b<-ggplot(firsts, aes(x=humidity_first, y=delayed_first)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
q4b<-q4b+ xlab("Humidity at supposed departure time") +  ylab("Delayed Time")
q4b

q4c<-ggplot(firsts, aes(x=wind_speed_first, y=delayed_first))+geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
q4c<-q4c+ xlab("Wind Speed at supposed departure time") +  ylab("Delayed Time (mins)")
q4c

```





## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Merge flights with ariports to know which state each airport is located in: 
flights_airports_states<-left_join(flights, airports, by =c("dest"="iata"))
flights_airports_states<-left_join(flights_airports_states, states, by ="state")
x<-strptime (flights_airports_states$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

#Create regional proportions per carrier: 
prop_carriers<- flights_airports_states %>% 
  mutate (month=month(x)) %>% 
  filter(month==7) %>%
  group_by(carrier, region) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  rename (regional_flights=n)
prop_carriers

#Create total number of flights per carrier: 
total_number_flights<-flights_airports_states %>% 
  mutate (month=month(x)) %>% 
  filter(month==7) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  rename (TNF=n) 
total_number_flights

#Impose the total number of flights per carrier on regional to create proportion:  
prop_carriers<-left_join(prop_carriers, total_number_flights, by="carrier")

prop_carriers<-prop_carriers %>% 
  mutate(RPF=round(regional_flights/TNF,3))

#Graph: 
q5<-ggplot(data=prop_carriers, aes(x=carrier, y=RPF, fill = region))+ geom_bar(stat="identity")+ylab("Proportion of Regional Flights")
q5
```
