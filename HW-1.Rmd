Please indicate

* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 3.5 hrs
* What gave you the most trouble: Understanding what objects are legal for what functions/ commands
* Any comments you have:





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

The graphical analysis of the proportion of flights, which were delayed by more than 30 minutes, broken down by months suggests that late spring and early summer are the seasons with most delays. Specifically, the porportoon of delays increases from 11.5% to 13.2% in the period between May and July. Conversly, autumn seems to witness the least amount of delays, fluctuating between 7.5% and 8.5% of all flights. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
x<-strptime(flights$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

flights<-flights %>% 
  mutate(month=month(x))
flights_day <- flights %>% 
  count(month) %>% 
  rename(num_flights_day=n)

delayed_flights <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay>30) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_flights_delayed = n)

delayed_flights<-delayed_flights %>% 
  mutate (Prop_flights_delayed = round(delayed_flights$num_flights_delayed/flights_day$num_flights_day,3))

ggplot(data=delayed_flights, aes(x = month, y = Prop_flights_delayed)) + geom_line() + xlab("Month") +  ylab("Proportion of Flights Delayed by >30 Mins") + ggtitle("Delayed Flights by Month of Year") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold")) + theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,20,0,0))) +     scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:12))
 #The Y-title was too close to the axis. 

```





## Question 2:

* Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?


In the 1970s, the airline industry witnessed considerable deregulations that allowed planes to be produced with less legroom; the average seat pitch has since dropped from 35 inces to 31 inches today (http://fortune.com/2015/09/12/airline-seats-shrink/). Consequently, customers who prefer more room should favor flying with Delta, since about 20% of its fleet is composed of airplanes manufactured before 1980. 

Note: This analysis excludes units of observation for which no year of manifacturing could be foun

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#1. Merge the planes dataset to the flights dataset: 
flights_planes<-left_join(flights, planes, by="plane")

#2. Proportion of Old Planes per carrier: 
num_planes_per_carrier <- flights_planes %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_planes=n)

num_old_planes_per_carrier<-flights_planes %>%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%

  rename(num_old_planes=n)

Old_planes<-flights_planes %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  mutate (Old_planes = round(num_old_planes_per_carrier$num_old_planes/num_planes_per_carrier$num_planes, 3)*100) %>%  
  arrange(desc(Old_planes))

```







## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?

It appears that the highest unique number of flights for WN is to Texas. Specifically, WN operates 770 annual unique flights to destinations in Texas, followed by 297 to Florida and 236 to Louisiana. Although the numbers are different, it appears that WN-operated flights tend to fly to the same three destinations, with 17,230 flights to TX, followed by 3,992 to FL and 3,362 to LA. The order, however, is not identical: WN operates more unique flights to New Mexico than Maryland, even though the oveall traffic of flights operated by WN is higher to Maryland than New Mexico.

## Question 4:

* What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?


The three graphs show a modest upwards trend, suggestive of the fact that as the weather condition increases in severity, so does the duration of a flight delayed. That is, for flights that were delayed more than 30 minutes (and less than 3 hours), higher temprature (humidity, or windspeed) is correlated with longer delays. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Dataframe with flights delayed more than 30 minutes: 
flights2<-flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay>30)

#Dataframe with weather patterns of interest: 
weather2<-weather %>% 
  select(date, hour, temp, humidity, wind_speed)

#Joining datasets: 
flights_weather<-left_join(flights2, weather2, by="date")

#Collapsing on flight: 
firsts<-flights_weather %>% 
  group_by(flight) %>% 
  summarise(temp_first=first(temp), 
            humidity_first=first(humidity), 
            wind_speed_first=first(wind_speed),
            delayed_first=first(dep_delay)) %>% 
  filter(delayed_first<180)

q4a<-ggplot(firsts, aes(x=temp_first, y=delayed_first)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
q4a<-q4a+ xlab("Temprature at planned departure time (F)") +  ylab("Delayed Time")
q4a+ ggtitle("Temprature vs. Delays") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))+ theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,20,0,0)))

q4b<-q4b+ xlab("Humidity at planned departure time") +  ylab("Delayed Time")+ ggtitle("Humidity vs. Delays") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))+ theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,20,0,0)))

q4c<-q4c+ xlab("Wind Speed at planned departure time") +  ylab("Delayed Time (mins)")+ theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,20,0,0)))

## Question 5:

* I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()` function from the `lubridate` package.

The graph below shows the proportion of regions each carrier flies to in the month of July. Notice that the grey color, unreported in the legend, reflects flights for which there was no information on the region of destination. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Merge flights with ariports to know which state each airport is located in: 
flights_airports_states<-left_join(flights, airports, by =c("dest"="iata"))
flights_airports_states<-left_join(flights_airports_states, states, by ="state")
x<-strptime (flights_airports_states$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

#Create regional proportions per carrier: 
prop_carriers<- flights_airports_states %>% 
  mutate (month=month(x)) %>% 
  filter(month==7) %>%
  group_by(carrier, region) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  rename (regional_flights=n)


#Create total number of flights per carrier: 
total_number_flights<-flights_airports_states %>% 
  mutate (month=month(x)) %>% 
  filter(month==7) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  rename (TNF=n) 

#Impose the total number of flights per carrier on regional to create proportion:  
prop_carriers<-left_join(prop_carriers, total_number_flights, by="carrier")

prop_carriers<-prop_carriers %>% 
  mutate(RPF=round(regional_flights/TNF,3))

#Graph: 
q5<-ggplot(data=prop_carriers, aes(x=carrier, y=RPF, fill = region))+ geom_bar(stat="identity")+ylab("Proportion of Regional Flights") +xlab("Carrier") + ggtitle("Regional Flights by Carrier") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))+ theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,20,0,0)))
