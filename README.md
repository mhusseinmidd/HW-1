# Homework 1

You are currently in the GitHub repo for HW-1. Please refer to the [HW
Submission 
Exercise](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#hw-submission-exercise)
from HW-0 on how to submit your assignment. This homework will cover the 
following topics:

* Data manipulation using `dplyr`
* Basic data visualization using `ggplot2`
* Reproducible research using R Markdown
* The importance of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The data we'll be looking at is:

* `flights` [227,496 x 14]: Every domestic flight departing Houston in 2011.
* `weather` [8,723 x 14]: Hourly weather data.
* `planes` [2,853 x 9]: Plane metadata.
* `airports` [3,376 x 7]: Airport metadata.
* `states` [48 x 3]: (Lower 48) state data.




## Administrative Notes

1. Please commit/push (submit) only a **compiling** (working) `HW-1.Rmd` file. If a
part of your code is not working, comment it out.
1. Please acknowledge all collaborators, how much time you spent, etc, in the
Administrative section of `HW-1.Rmd`
1. Important dates:
    + **(Optional) Feedback request due:** Wed March 2nd 11:15am
    + **HW due:** Wed March 9th 11:15am
    + **Revision due:** Wed March 16th 11:15am. Lecture will be held in the Wilson Media Lab (1st floor of David Library).
1. We will have a discussion on R Markdown (`.Rmd` files) on Monday 2/29. If you are not familiar with R Markdown, 
do your work on a separate `.R` script file for now (File -> New File -> R Script).





## Tips

1. It's best to do your initial work in a new R script file and after you're
done, start copying things over to the `HW-1.Rmd` file.
1. While doing your initial work, set the working directory to be the root
directory of your project:
    + Navigate to the folder `HW-1` in the File panel
    + Click *More* -> *Set As Working Directory*
1. Work in groups. Many people learn to code better in groups.
1. One skill you'll be developing is having good **programming practices**. For
example, Google has their own [R Style 
Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml). Give it a
look, but don't worry about getting it all right the first time, I'll be giving 
feedback as the semester progresses.
1. Google is a programmer's best friend! [http://xkcd.com/627/](http://xkcd.com/627/)
1. Do not spin your wheels: Don’t be stuck for more than 20 minutes.
This takes self-awareness and mindfulness. After 20 minutes of frustration, take
a break and/or seek help.
